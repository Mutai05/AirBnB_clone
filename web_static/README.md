### What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the basic structure of a web page by using a set of elements or tags to define the different parts of the content such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

### How to create an HTML page?

To create an HTML page, you need to follow a basic structure. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### What is a markup language?

A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. It is used to add formatting information to a text document, indicating elements such as headings, lists, paragraphs, links, etc.

### What is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements and attributes. The DOM provides a way for programs to manipulate the structure, style, and content of web documents.

### What is an element/tag?

An HTML element or tag is a fundamental component of an HTML document. It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, a paragraph element is represented by `<p>` and `</p>` tags.

### What is an attribute?

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always included in the opening tag. They are usually in the form of name/value pairs. For example:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

Here, `href` is an attribute of the `<a>` (anchor) element.

### How does the browser load a webpage?

1. The browser receives the HTML file.
2. It parses the HTML to construct the DOM.
3. The browser fetches external resources like stylesheets and scripts.
4. It renders the webpage on the user's screen.

### What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It allows you to control the presentation, layout, and design of web pages.

### How to add style to an element?

You can add style to an HTML element by using the `style` attribute or by linking an external CSS file. For example:

Inline style:
```html
<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
```

External style (in a separate CSS file):
```css
/* styles.css */
p {
    color: blue;
}
```

### What is a class?

A class is a way to apply a set of styles or behavior to multiple HTML elements. You can assign a class to an element using the `class` attribute.

```html
<p class="highlight">This paragraph has a special style.</p>
```

### What is a selector?

A selector is a pattern that is used to select and style one or more HTML elements. In CSS, selectors define which elements the style rules apply to.

```css
/* Selecting all paragraphs */
p {
    color: red;
}

/* Selecting elements with a class of 'highlight' */
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

### How to compute CSS Specificity Value?

CSS specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determining which styles are applied to an element. Specificity is calculated based on the combination of selectors used. It is usually represented as four numbers separated by commas. The higher the specificity, the higher the priority of the style.

### What are Box properties in CSS?

Box properties in CSS refer to the properties that control the layout and dimensions of an element's box model. These properties include `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, and `border`. They define how much space an element takes up, how it is positioned, and how it interacts with other elements on the page. Understanding and manipulating box properties is crucial for creating well-designed and responsive layouts in CSS.
